 Monkey HTTP Daemon - Install
 ============================

 For optimum functioning, i recommend that Monkey be compiled with GCC >= 
 2.95.3 and be running on a Linux OS with kernel >= 2.6.28.

 Like every source program we must run 'configure' script and later
 'make':

 #./configure
 # make 
 
 Optionally, you have the option of 'make install',which will copy the main
 directory of monkey where it has been specificated in the script
 configure.

 Running Monkey
 ==============

	bin/monkey

	or

	bin/monkey -D (to run monkey in background mode)
	
 Optionally, you can specificate the directory whe the configuration files
 are found, this can be done the following way: 

	bin/monkey -D -c conf/
	
 This argument (conf/) was thought of for those wishing to have Monkey
 running for various users, in distinctive Ports and it's own 
 configuration files. For more information see 'conf/monkey.conf'.

 For more info try -h option.

 Testing Monkey
 ==============
 
 To see that Monkey is running, make a requisite from your lynx or
 netscape:
 
 	# lynx 127.0.0.1:2001
 	
 Note: In this example the '2001' corresponds to the connection port
 assigned on 'conf/monkey.conf'.
