Liana SSL Networking Plugin
===========================

Liana SSL is the base network plugin for Monkey, as it's brother
provides some basic socket calls to work over SSL

To enable the this plugin you must enable it using the configure script
and disabling the liana plugin:

  ./configure --enable-plugins="liana_ssl"

in the plugins/liana_ssl directory then edit plugins.load and comment the
the line where it enables monkey-liana.so.

Your keys must go on conf/plugins/liana_ssl/liana_ssl.conf with the
proper format.

If you want to test the ssl support you can generate a certificate and
key files using these commands:

openssl genrsa -out privkey.pem 1024
openssl req -new -x509 -key privkey.pem -out cert.pem -days 1095
