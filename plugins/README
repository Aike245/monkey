Monkey Plugins
==============
Plugins are extra features which modifies the Monkey behavior, all of them
are shared libraries which are loaded on runtime. 

Each plugin is loaded per configuration instruction and it will work on a 
defined stage. Monkey has different cycles since a connection is accepted until
it's finished. Stages are defined as levels:

MK_PLUGIN_STAGE_10: Server has not yet entered in the server loop, no 
		    listeners yet available
MK_PLUGIN_STAGE_20: Accepted connection has not been assigned to worker thread
MK_PLUGIN_STAGE_30: HTTP Request received
MK_PLUGIN_STAGE_40: Object Handler
MK_PLUGIN_STAGE_50: Request ended
MK_PLUGIN_STAGE_60: Connection closed
