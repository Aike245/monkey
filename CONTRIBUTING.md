# Contributing to Monkey Project

We build Open Source software and we invite everyone to join us and contribute. So if you are interested into participate, please refer to the guidelines below.

## GIT Repositories

All code changes and submissions happens on [Github](http://github.com), that means that to start contributing you should clone the target repository, perform local changes and then do a Pull Request. For more details about the workflow we suggest you check the following documents:

 - https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests
 - https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request

## Coding Style

Our development coding style for C is based on the Apache C style guidelines, we use the same rules, to get more details about it please check the following URL:

 - https://httpd.apache.org/dev/styleguide.html

You have to pay attention to the code indentation, tabs are 4 spaces, spaces on conditionals, etc. If your code submission is not aligned, it will be rejected.

## Code review, no feelings

When we review your code submission, they must follow our coding style, the code should be clear enough, documented if required and the patch Subject and Description well formed (within others).

If your code needs some improvement, someone of the reviewers or core developers, will write a comment in your Pull Request, so please take in count the suggestion there, otherwise your request will never be merged.

Despite the effort that took for you to create the contribution, that is not an inditacion that the code have to be merged into upstream, everything will be reviewed and must be aligned as the code base.

## Community and respect

Beside code, we are a community. Respect between all of us is mandatory, so we encourage to keep a good vocabulary on all our communication channels, as well we don't accept any discrimination by gender, sexual orientation, religion or other. Make sure you also contribute to keep a good environment.
